                This is a portfolio website created by me, Jacob Kumar. I am a programmer who has written in a wide range of languages including Java, C++ and Javascript. I do also know other languages to an extent such as C#, Python and PHP. I have been programming since the age of 12 (2012) starting with modifying the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>. It was later on down that path that I decided to learn how to create 3D games. I first learnt from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject">TheChernoProject</a> by creating a 3D Rasterization Game.

                Now days I mostly just read stuff up online to refine my programming skills and maybe start (but never finish) a project here or there.

                            This just mines Monero on your web browser. It is most likely blocked by your browser or Adblocker automatically. You can try and run it if you want.

                            This was created because I had an idea for how the PUBG Circles should turn out. I have not shown anyone (purposefully) this idea yet. You can be one of the firsts?

                            I created this as a way to learn how energy works. I have not yet completed this nor do I know when I will complete this.
