                This is a portfolio website created by me, Jacob Kumar. I am a programmer who has written in a wide range of languages including Java, C++ and Javascript. I do also know other languages to an extent such as C#, Python and PHP. I have been programming since the age of 12 (2012) starting with modifying the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>. It was later on down that path that I decided to learn how to create 3D games. I first learnt from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject">TheChernoProject</a> by creating a 3D Rasterization Game.

                Now days I mostly just read stuff up online to refine my programming skills and maybe start (but never finish) a project here or there.

                            This was created because I had an idea for how the PUBG Circles should turn out. I have not shown anyone (purposefully) this idea yet. You can be one of the firsts?

                            I created this as a way to learn how energy and forces in physics works. I have not yet completed this nor do I know when I will complete this as I am currently done with the sub-topic Energy and Forces in physics class. I will probably start back up on it near my exams.

                            This was basically the way I learnt C++ by forking and adding on to this codebase. I've changed the renderer to a Defferred rendering model instead of a Forward renderer and I added animations. I also did change some other major systems. Earlier on before I lost the code (I didn't push to github) I partially implemented Lua scripting.
